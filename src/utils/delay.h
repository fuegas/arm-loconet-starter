/**
 * @file delay.h
 * @brief Adds functionality to use delays
 *
 * Adds methods to let the program wait for a certain amount of time. The time
 * to wait can be specified in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds. Waiting a
 * certain amount of microseconds is as precise as I would like but it comes
 * very close. The deviation for milliseconds and seconds are less than 1% but
 * are at least(!) the specified time.
 *
 * Note: The current implementation only works for a chip running on default
 * speed (8MHz).
 *
 * Note: Interrupts will fire and take time to process. This can cause a delay
 * to take longer than specified. The main loop however will wait for this
 * delay to finish as it is implementated using busy waiting.
